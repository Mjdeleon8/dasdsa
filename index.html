          Traditions in the Philippines that slowly forgotten
        </h1>
        <p>
          The Filipino culture is a rich fusion of traditional Filipino customs
          and Spanish Catholic influences, infused with elements from America
          and other Asian regions. Known for their strong emphasis on family
          ties and religious values, Filipinos also have a deep appreciation for
          art, fashion, music, and culinary delights.

          Those who have engaged in traditional Filipino games like piko,
          patintero, or tumbang-preso are fortunate to have experienced the joy
          these games bring. Unfortunately, contemporary children tend to favor
          digital devices such as iPads, Xbox, and mobile games over the outdoor
          play and camaraderie with fellow kids.

          Folk beliefs, also referred to as "superstitious beliefs," are
          integral to a community's values and culture. They mirror the customs,
          traditions, and norms of a group, often rooted in religious beliefs,
          opinions, or age-old practices. These beliefs offer insights into how
          a community perceives the unknown and the rituals to appease the gods
          shaping their destiny. However, in today's era, many millennials
          dismiss these superstitious beliefs as mere sayings held by the older
          generation, considering them unreal and not applicable to their lives.

          In the past, Filipinos adhered to conservative attire, avoiding the
          display of too much skin in public, particularly among girls. However,
          significant shifts have occurred in Filipino fashion, largely
          influenced by Western countries.

          The "Mano" or "pagmamano" is a traditional Filipino gesture signifying
          respect for elders and seeking their blessings. In this gesture,
          reminiscent of hand-kissing, the person bowing towards the elder
          gently presses their forehead to the elder's hand. Regrettably, this
          meaningful tradition is fading away, gradually replaced by alternative
          forms of showing respect, such as the "beso-beso" (cheek-to-cheek
          greeting). While still respectful, it lacks the distinctive charm of
          the original pagmamano.

          The Harana, a serenading tradition in rural Philippines, served as a
          formal way for young men to meet single ladies. However, with the
          advent of technology, the landscape of dating has transformed. Today,
          teenagers often utilize platforms like Messenger or DMs to express
          their "panliligaw" to someone they fancy. A simple message, a hopeful
          reply, and the rest becomes history. In many parts of the country,
          traditional courtship practices, like harana and paninilbihan (where a
          suitor performs chores for the girl's family to prove his love), are
          on the brink of extinction due to these changes.
